          <p>Her brilliant ability to juxtapose tradition and innovation is seen in every riveting masterpiece that she creates with loving and effortless detail with delicate nuances, bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase “Poetry in motion”.</p>
          <p>Padmaja’s belief in every child being able to reach individualized pinnacles of perfection is embodied in her demand for perfection in the execution of mudras, adavus, bhedas, and karanas while striving to build and hone the endurance to perform flawlessly with utmost dedication and devotion.</p>
